sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: The bubble sort algorithm works by running through the array several times, and 
comparing two elements each time. When the larger element is found relative to the next, it switches 
places.

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: The merge sort algorithm uses a strategy called divide and conquer.
How so? Recursively it divides the problem into smaller problems until the smallest possibility,
which is when it solves each one. Once this is done, it adds the solved problems together until
the initial problem is solved.

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: The selection sort algorithm works by running through the array several times comparing
each element, and when it finds one that is out of place, it changes it.
